How It All Began and What Future Holds for Us?
KOSMOS SOLAR is the brainchild of Kevin Seok, a proud Korean/Texan, who set foundations of this company after realizing there’s a huge gap between consumer needs and installers’ offering. A firm believer in green and clean energy himself, he devoted this company to make a difference in the lives of Texans, consequently contributing in making America (and the whole world) cleaner and greener and better place to live in. 
Ever since our inception, we have grown remarkably, both in size and reputation, which has further strengthened our resolve to cater to the energy requirements of people in and around Arlington in more cleaner, greener and efficient manner.
Why Us? 
Because we love what we do and believe in the long term positive effects on the lives of people and future of the planet we all call home. Unlike most solar installers who are in the trade to make some quick bucks, we are here to stay, to make a positive difference in the lives of fellow Texans, bringing them cleaner, greener and more efficient energy solutions in the most reliable and affordable manner.",11.0,50.0,https://www.kosmossolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kosmos-Thicken-logo.png,,,,,
